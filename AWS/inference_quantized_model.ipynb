FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds as follows:\\n            (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \\n        Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during \\n        the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's \\n        history.\\n            (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on \\n        February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency \\n        through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \\n        commitment to the United States.\\n            (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham \\n        Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.\\n            (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \\n        toward none and with charity for all.\\n            (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \\n        country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, \\n        1865.\\n            (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \\n        Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \\n        accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, \\n        integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\\n            (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \\n        the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\\n            (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood \\n        in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in \\n        Washington, D.C.\\n            (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 \\n        on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse \\n        design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.\\n            (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the \\n        talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to \\n        design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting \\n        a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\\n            (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln \\n        cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the \\n        original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing \\n        mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial \\n        in Washington, D.C.\\n            (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President \\n        Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of \\n        the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of \\n        1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of \\n        the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\\n\\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Secondary Metal \\nTheft Prevention Act of 2009''.\\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as \\nfollows:\\n\\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\\nSec. 2. Findings.\\nSec. 3. Sense of the Congress.\\nSec. 4. Purposes.\\nSec. 5. Purchase transaction requirements.\\nSec. 6. Protection of personal information.\\nSec. 7. Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.\\nSec. 8. Enforcement by State Attorneys General.\\nSec. 9. Civil penalty.\\nSec. 10. State and local law not preempted.\\nSec. 11. Definitions.\\nSec. 12. Effective date.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Since 2006, metal theft has been on the rise, largely \\n        due to a surge in the global demand for scrap metal and a \\n        historic increase in the price of metal commodities.\\n            (2) Theft of metal components is jeopardizing the integrity \\n        of critical infrastructure in the United States through theft \\n        of metal in transportation, electrical, and telecommunications \\n        networks.\\n            (3) Theft of manhole covers, storm water grates, highway \\n        guard rails, railroad tracks, automobile components, and street \\n        lamps pose a significant public safety risk.\\n            (4) Many State laws call on secondary metal recyclers to \\n        help deter this crime and assist law enforcement by documenting \\n        transactions and collecting information in order to identify \\n        the sellers of scrap metal and the material they are selling. \\n        These laws have been a significant deterrent to the problem of \\n        metal theft.\\n            (5) Although many States have enacted metal theft laws, \\n        metal theft is a nationwide crime that crosses state lines.\\n            (6) An overarching Federal law is necessary to deter metal \\n        theft across the country.\\n            (7) Combating the problem of metal theft will require \\n        improved communications between metal businesses and law \\n        enforcement agencies.\\n            (8) The secondary metal recycling industry should be \\n        commended for educating the public and law enforcement to the \\n        problems related to metal theft, issuing ``Do Not Buy'' lists, \\n        partnering with the National Crime Prevention Council, and \\n        creating a Theft Alert System.\\n\\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\\n\\n    It is the sense of the Congress that Federal, State, and local \\ngovernment agencies should work with representatives of the secondary \\nmetal recycling industry to develop and improve effective \\ncountermeasures to combat the theft and sale of stolen secondary metal.\\n\\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\\n\\n    The purposes of this Act are--\\n            (1) to protect consumers, businesses, critical \\n        infrastructure, and State and local governments from the \\n        problem of secondary metal theft;\\n            (2) to regulate interstate commerce by limiting trafficking \\n        in stolen secondary metal sold for the purpose of recycling or \\n        reuse;\\n            (3) to permit legitimate secondary metal transactions to \\n        continue to take place; and\\n            (4) to establish a system to document secondary metal \\n        transactions between sellers and buyers while addressing the \\n        growing problem of secondary metal theft.\\n\\nSEC. 5. PURCHASE TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS.\\n\\n    (a) Do-not-buy List.--Unless the seller establishes by written \\ndocumentation that the seller is the owner, or an employee, agent, or \\nother person authorized to sell on behalf of the owner, it is unlawful \\nfor a secondary metal recycling agent to purchase for recycling any \\nsecondary metal that is--\\n            (1) marked with name, logo, or initials of a railroad, an \\n        electric, gas, or water company, a telephone company, cable \\n        company, or a public utility or that has been altered to \\n        remove, conceal, or obliterate such a name, logo, or initials \\n        through burning or cutting of wire sheathing or other means;\\n            (2) marked with the name of a city, county, or State \\n        government entity;\\n            (3) a street light pole or fixture;\\n            (4) a road or bridge guard rail;\\n            (5) a highway or street sign;\\n            (6) a water meter cover;\\n            (7) a storm water grate;\\n            (8) unused or undamaged building construction or utility \\n        material;\\n            (9) an historical marker;\\n            (10) a grave marker or cemetery urn or vase;\\n            (11) a utility access cover; or\\n            (12) a bulk container for beer with a capacity of 7.75 \\n        gallons or more.\\n    (b) Record Keeping.--\\n            (1) In general.--A secondary metal recycling agent shall \\n        maintain a written or electronic record of each secondary metal \\n        purchase.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to pass \\n        civil rights legislation which culminated in the enactment of \\n        the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\\n            (8) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly expanded civil \\n        rights protections, outlawing racial discrimination and \\n        segregation in public places and places of public \\n        accommodation, in federally funded programs and employment and \\n        encouraging desegregation in public schools, and has served as \\n        a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws;\\n            (9) we are an eminently better Nation because of Rosa \\n        Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and all those men and women \\n        who have confronted, and continue to confront, injustice and \\n        inequality wherever they see it;\\n            (10) equality in education was one of the cornerstones of \\n        the civil rights movement;\\n            (11) on September 10, 1961, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \\n        wrote that African American ``students are coming to understand \\n        that education and learning have become tools for shaping the \\n        future and not devices of privilege for an exclusive few'';\\n            (12) over its long and distinguished history, the United \\n        Negro College Fund has provided scholarships and operating \\n        funds to its member colleges that have enabled more than \\n        300,000 young African Americans to earn college degrees and \\n        become successful members of society;\\n            (13) those graduates include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \\n        as well as leaders in the fields of education, science, \\n        medicine, law, entertainment, literature, the military, and \\n        politics who have made major contributions to the civil rights \\n        movement and the creation of a more equitable society;\\n            (14) Congress has an obligation to lead America's continued \\n        struggle to fight discrimination and ensure equal rights for \\n        all; and\\n            (15) the year 2014 will mark the semicentennial of the \\n        passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\n\\nSEC. 3.
